    Remove incubating messages from API

    This PR removes the GeoBoundingBox and GeoBoundingPolygon from the API. It's been decided that generally processors should return coordinates in pixel-space, and it is up to a separate component to map pixel coordinates to geodetic coordinates for mapping purposes.

    These message types were added in an incubating fashion and it is not expected that they are being used or will cause widespread breakages.
